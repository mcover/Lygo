Lygo is an exploration game. In Lygo the player starts off connected to a world via a cable, and has to find upgrades to his small ship that will allow him to explore his surroundings further, and eventually seperate (unplug) from his world and venture towards new worlds.

We set out to create a game about the feeling of leaving home, how it is scary and might be difficult, but through that experience you can grow and evolve, and find a new home. The player eventually comes back to each of his homes and makes them better, and eventually manages to free himself from the shackles of him and live as a free spirit, at home wherever it goes.
