Lygo: documentation

How to make a build:  
*Log into the Perforce server.
*Expand the Philip folder in 2015
*Right click on the UnityProject folder
*Choose "Get Latest Revision"
*Open Unity
*Select "open other" and navigate in your Perforce workspace to the UnityProject folder
*Double-check the build settings, Lygo should be scene 1 and loader should be scene 0
*Building from this will get you a working build
NOTE: To see start screen when building in Unity, you need to play the loader scene. Otherwise, you will just see 
the beginning of the game without the start screen. In the actual build this is handled by the build settings having
loader as 0.
